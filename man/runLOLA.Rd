\usage{
runLOLA(userSets, userUniverse, regionDB, minOverlap = 1, cores = 1,
  redefineUserSets = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{userSets}{Regions of interest}

\item{userUniverse}{Regions tested for inclusion in userSets}

\item{regionDB}{Region DB to check for overlap, from loadRegionDB()}

\item{minOverlap}{(Default:1) Minimum bases required to count an overlap}

\item{cores}{Number of processors}

\item{redefineUserSets}{run redefineUserSets() on your userSets?}
}
\value{
Data.table with enrichment results. Rows correspond to individual
pairwise fisher's tests comparing a single userSet with a single databaseSet.
The columns in this data.table are: userSet and dbSet: index into their
respective input region sets. pvalueLog: -log(pvalue) from the fisher's exact
result; logOddsRatio: result from the fisher's exact test; support: number of
regions in userSet overlapping databaseSet; rnkPV, rnkLO, rnkSup: rank in this
table of p-value, logOddsRatio, and Support respectively. The --value is the
negative natural log of the p-value returned from a one-sided fisher's exact
test. maxRnk, meanRnk: max and mean of the 3 previous ranks, providing a
combined ranking system. b, c, d: 3 other values completing the 2x2 contingency
table (with support). The remaining columns describe the dbSet for the row.
}
\description{
Workhorse function that calculates overlaps between userSets,
and then uses a fisher's exact test rank them by significance
of the overlap.

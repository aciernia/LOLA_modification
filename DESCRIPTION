Title: Locus overlap analysis for enrichment of genomic ranges
Description: Provides functions for testing overlap of sets of genomic regions
    with public and custom region set (genomic ranges) databases. This makes it
    possible to do automated enrichment analysis for genomic region sets, thus
    facilitating interpretation of functional genomics and epigenomics data.
